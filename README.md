# mlops-stock-prediction

This repository shows an example of how to operationalize machine learning models. For a baseline example, we take the stock market data of S&P500 from using the YFinance api in Python and build a machine learning model. From there, we go on a journey on how to streamline our machine learning model development lifecycle. To take this journey, follow the instructions below:

1. Set up a KubeFlow pipeline instance on GCP using AI pipelines.
2. Set up a notebook instance on GCP or locally.
3. Go through *Predicting SP500.ipynb* notebook.
4. Go through the KFP *SP500.ipynb* notebook.
